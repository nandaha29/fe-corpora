      "content": "What does corpus and corpora mean? In the classic linguistics, corpus often defines \"a collection of utterances recorded on a tape or taken down from dictation\" (Martinet, 1960:40). Susan Hunston (2002), one of the pioneers of the linguistics corpora in the English Department at the University of Birmingham, introduces modern uses of corpus studies through her book, Corpora in Applied Linguistics. The word of corpus is referring to \"a collection of naturally occurring examples of language, consisting of anything from a few sentences to a set of written texts or tape recordings, which have been collected for linguistic study. More recently, the word has been reserved for collections of texts (or parts of text) that are stored and accessed electronically\" (Hunston, 2002:2). What we learned from previous scholars on corpora implies that corpus is focusing on collecting of textual artefact. However, as we know that cultural artefacts have multilayered aspects (Arps 2016:28-29). We also agree that textuality are the vital aspects in making sense the complexity of multistranded of cultural artefacts. Considering the complexity of understanding the cultural artefacts, we propose that textual corpora in this regard should be accompanied by non-textual element. So, we are trying to initiate the corpus-multimodal in specific context.\n\nIn this project, we are trying to introduce the peculiarity of cultural expression of East Java through digital platform. East Java has unique cultural landscapes (see figure 1) and symbolizes variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and cultural artefacts. The specific purpose of this project is documenting, selecting, presenting cultural artefact in the existing of subcultures in East Java. More specifically, we are focusing to document culture-specific expressions, also known as culture-specific items, words or phrases that carries a particular meaning in special context. Those words are so hard to find equivalent words to other languages (translation challenges) because their concepts may not exist or be understood in other cultures. Apart from the textuality, this project present non-textual element through advance media, e.g., videos, photos, music, and 3D model.\nBy combining software engineering expertise and humanities approaches, this project is endeavored to provide database of textual artefacts and its multimodal."
